A small python script that reads in every word from the english oxford dictionary, takes in a users input of 9 letters and compares all permutaions of the letters against the list of words, returns a list sorted by the longest matching word first.

The script returns the list of matched words less then a second after the users input.

## Rules of Countdown
The contestant in control chooses between two stacks of letter tiles, one containing vowels and the other consonants, and Riley reveals the top tile from that stack and places it on the board. This is done nine times, and the final grouping must contain at least three vowels and four consonants. The contestants then have 30 seconds to form the longest single word they can, using the nine revealed letters; no letter may be used more often than it appears in the selection. The frequencies of the letters within each stack are weighted according to their frequency in natural English, in the same manner as Scrabble. For example, there are many Ns and Rs in the consonant stack, but only one Q. The letter frequencies are altered by the producers from time to time, so any published list does not necessarily reflect the letters used in any particular programme.
